# Nova Scotia's Path to Net-Zero: Tidal vs. Wind Energy

## Decision Statement
> [!TIP] 
> This is a noble ambition, and actually on that i am actively researching.  I can say that there is very little public data for Nova Scotia related to the effectiveness of the energy mix, partly due to Nova Scotia Power being a private company, and partly related to their cybersecurity breach - as a result of that hack, access to energy mix/efficacy is closed. 
> I'd like to recommend you simplify your life, and focus on informing UN SDG Goal 7.  Pick a target from here https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal7. There is a lot of data available on this - consider rephrasing your question to "Do we need to invest more to maintain our trajectory to meeting our Canadian climate targets?"  And we can do a trend analysis later using something more sophisticated than a linear line - perhaps ARIMA forecasting.
 
The Government of Nova Scotia chooses to invest in a hybrid energy approach, combining tidal and wind energy to meet 2050 net-zero emissions targets.

## Executive Summary

Nova Scotia faces a critical decision in choosing between tidal energy infrastructure and wind energy expansion to meet its ambitious net-zero emissions targets by 2050. The decision hinges on balancing economic development, grid reliability, and environmental impact. Tidal energy offers predictability and local job creation, while wind energy provides established technology and scalability.

A hybrid approach could optimize benefits, but requires careful evaluation of costs, infrastructure readiness, and community engagement. The Government of Nova Scotia must weigh these factors to ensure a sustainable energy future for its residents.

## Initial CLD

*Rough CLD*

- Investment in Tidal Energy (+) → Energy Costs (+)
- Investment in Wind Energy (+) → Energy Costs (-)
- Energy Costs (-) → Greenhouse Gas Emissions (+)
- Greenhouse Gas Emissions (-) → Environmental Impact (+)
- Environmental Impact (-) → Investment in Tidal/Wind Energy (+)
- Grid Reliability (+) → Economic Development (+)
- Economic Development (+) → Investment in Tidal/Wind Energy (+)

*Feedback Loop (Reinforcing):*
- Investment in Tidal Energy → Energy Costs → Greenhouse Gas Emissions → Environmental Impact → Investment in Tidal Energy (R)

The key feedback loop is a reinforcing loop (R): 
Investment in Tidal Energy → Energy Costs → Greenhouse Gas Emissions → Environmental Impact → Investment in Tidal Energy. 

This loop suggests that investing in tidal energy can lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improving environmental impact, which in turn can encourage further investment in tidal energy, amplifying the effect.
