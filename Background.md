 Decision Context: Tidal vs. Wind Energy in Nova Scotia
 Why does this decision matter? What are the stakes?
Nova Scotia is at a crossroads in its energy transition, with tidal and wind energy emerging as key players in achieving its clean energy goals. The decision to prioritize one over the other, or to balance both, has significant implications for the province's energy security, economic development, and environmental sustainability. With a target of 80% clean electricity by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050, Nova Scotia must carefully consider its energy mix.

What makes this decision difficult? What tensions or tradeoffs exist?
The decision is challenging due to several tradeoffs:
- Cost vs. Predictability: Tidal energy is more predictable but currently more expensive than wind energy, which is intermittent but cheaper.
- Environmental Impact: Both energy sources have environmental concerns, with tidal energy potentially disrupting marine ecosystems and wind energy affecting bird habitats.
- Technological Maturity: Wind energy technology is more mature, while tidal energy is still in the early stages of commercialization.

Who are the key stakeholders affected by this decision?
- Government of Nova Scotia: Responsible for meeting clean energy targets and regulating the energy sector.
- Indigenous Communities: Have rights and interests in energy development, particularly in traditional territories.
- Energy Companies: Invest in and operate energy projects, seeking stable returns on investment.
- Environmental Groups: Advocate for minimizing environmental impacts and prioritizing renewable energy.
- Local Communities: Affected by energy infrastructure and seeking economic benefits.

 What has been tried before, or what is the current approach?
- Tidal Energy: Nova Scotia has tested tidal energy projects, including the Annapolis Tidal Generating Station and projects by Sustainable Marine Energy, but faces challenges with technology and regulatory approvals.
- Wind Energy: The province has developed onshore wind farms and plans offshore wind projects, aiming for 5 GW of offshore wind leases by 2030.
